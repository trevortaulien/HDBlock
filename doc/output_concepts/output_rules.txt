The generated HDBlock output will be one of two options.

1. A block diagram that shows the hierarchy of the VHDL blocks with no connections between any of the blocks. The block diagram will
   be output as a .svg file that can then be loaded into other editors (Visio, draw.io) where the user can highlight the appropriate
   connections or use the diagram as is.

2. HDBlock will draw the connections. The type of connection drawn will follow the following rules:
   a. The connections will only show if there is any type of interface between blocks (e.g. ports in and/or out).
   b. Arrow heads will be used to demonstrate direction of ports in and/or out of any one block.
   c. Color of the blocks will be used to denote the level that a given block exists at.
   d. Connections cannot travel up/or down levels they must stay at the same level
      (in order to go up/down the connection must connect to an edge of an block that encapsulates it).
